This repository contains the deliverables for Project 2: Reproducibility in Natural Language Processing for Statistics 159/259, Fall 2025 at UC Berkeley.

This group project focuses on implementing and critically evaluating modern NLP pipelines, moving from foundational text processing techniques to advanced topic modeling using both traditional (LDA) and state-of-the-art (BERTopic) methods. A core emphasis of this assignment is on reproducibility, requiring a structured repository, clear documentation, and a deployed MyST site.
